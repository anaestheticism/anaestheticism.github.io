# About me

## Hey. I'm Kat.
I'm a 20-year old self-taught artist from Athens, GR. My work is inspired by my background in STEM and medicine, and my own personal struggles.

## Through my art, I tell my story.

I deal with heavy topics. My work is full of symbolism and references to mental illness, trauma and addiction. Consider this a trigger warning.

Art is an outlet for me. Through it, I also hope to raise awareness and to comfort those who relate.

## I'd love to help bring your vision to life!

I'll be honest, I'm not good with the business side of art. But lately I've been getting requests for commissions- it makes me very happy to see that people like my style and want me to help with their creative visions.

I don't have set prices, I like to let people decide what they can offer, and what they think is fair.

## I also do tattoos!

I am open for free (or very cheap) tattoos as long as I'm learning. If you're in Athens, hit me up!
